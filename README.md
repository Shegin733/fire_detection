# Forest Fire Detection System
Forest Fire is Increasing Intensity Globally, Satellite data indicates that forest fires are intensifying worldwide, burning nearly twice as much tree cover as they did 20 years ago1. These fires contribute significantly to carbon emissions and pose a threat to ecosystems.

## What's Inside?
1) Livestream image processing python backend trained on machine-learned robust adaboost classifier able to identify fire based on pixel charecteristics.
2) IoT environment with wifi enabled data streaming of sensor values captured from Temperature and smoke sensor
3) Flutter Web App with a credential-check forest officer login,that serves as an integration platform to check the presence of fire based on image processed live stream and IoT environment and a google locater
   to show the location of sensor placed.
4)Threat alert by alarm
